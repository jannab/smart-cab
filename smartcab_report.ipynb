    "In the project “Train a Smartcab to Drive”, a smartcab operating in an idealized grid-like city is given. There are traffic lights at each intersection and other cars present. The smartcab gets a reward for obeying traffic rules and a penalty for not obeying traffic rules or causing an accident. Goal of this project is to implement a learning agent for the smartcab that should learn an optimal policy for driving on city roads, obeying traffic rules correctly, and trying to reach the destination within a goal time based on the rewards and penalties it gets."
